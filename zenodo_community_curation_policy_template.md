# Zenodo Curation Policy Template

> Text boxes like this one are comments and can be deleted in the actual policy. Text, `marked like this` has to be adjusted to your needs. Apart from this, anything in this document can and should be adjusted to your needs.

This is the curation policy of `SLUB Dresden`. Submitted records have to adhere to the rules defined below. Community curators have the right apply changes to the metadata of your record, request you to update your record according to the rules below or reject your submission. The policy defines general requirements and specifies them further by record type.



## General

When submitting a record, the metadata fields ***Description* and *Licenses* are mandatory**. Below you find a table with comments/recommendations on a selection of Zenodos Metadata fields.

| Field | Comment |
|-|-|
| Creators | When entering a new creator, try to identify them by their OCRID iD. This automatically fills the fields *family name*, *given names* and *affiliations* if available at ORCID. We encourage you to register an [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/). </br>When entering an affiliation, check if the institution is registered at [ROR](https://ror.org/) and enter the affiliation accordingly if so. An affiliation is connected to the ROR, if the symbol appears of the left of its name (<img src="./assets/ror.png" alt="Description" style="height:12pt;"/>). You can check for this in the record's preview. In the *Affiliations* field `TU Dresden` is correctly identified by the string `TU Dresden (TUD)`.|
